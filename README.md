wordclock
=========

**wordclock** is a simple jQuery implementation of [QLOCKTWO](http://www.qlocktwo.com/?lang=en), which displays the current time as words instead of numbers.

See the QLOCKTWO version, which rounds to the nearest five minutes, [here](http://robertcalise.github.io/wordclock/) or check out the [alternate version](https://robertcalise.github.io/wordclock/alt.html), which is a bit more fun!
